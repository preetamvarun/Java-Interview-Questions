1) What is a process ?
Ans) A process is an execution of a program. It requires memory space to get executed. Like for example, running an app on the desktop. One or more threads will make a process.


2) What is a thread ?
Ans) A thread is a separation execution path in the program. A program can have one or more threads. Unlike processes, all threads in the program share same memory space.
Threads are light-weight compared to processes. Switching between threads is not as costly as switching between processes. In mutli-threaded langauges, it better to use approach
to reduce the idle time of the cpu. In java, by default we will get the main thread.

There are two types of multi-tasking are there. 1) Process based mutli-tasking and thread based multi-tasking.
