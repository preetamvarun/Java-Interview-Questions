Differences between interfaces and abstract classes

-> abstract classes are defined with abstract keyword.
-> Interfaces are defined with interface keyword.
-> Both abstract classes and interfaces contains concrete methods
-> Variables in interfaces should be public static final. This is not the case in
abstract classes.
-> A class can extend only one abstract class whereas a class can implement one or more
interfaces.
-> functions that are not abstract in interfaces can only be default or private. whereas
In abstract class any non abstract method can be public, private, protected or default.
-> All the classes that implements interfaces or extends abstract class should implement
all the abstract methods.
-> we need to explicitly specify that a method is abstract  method in an abstract class.
In case of interfaces we don't need to specify abstract keyword. By default it is assumed
that the method is abstract.
-> we can achieve multiple inheritance using interfaces.
-> We can have a constructor for abstract class. Whereas, we can't have a constructor for an interface
