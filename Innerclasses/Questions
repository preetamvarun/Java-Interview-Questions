Q1) WHAT ARE NESTED CLASSES IN JAVA ?

ANS) A class which is declared under another class is called a nested class in java.

There are two types of nested classes are there in java

1) static nested class

2) non-static nested class

we can have several types of nested classes. Like class inside a class. This class can
either be static or non-static. We can define a class inside a method. But This class
can't be accessed outside the method.


Q2) Explain about anonymous inner classes.

i) An anonymous class that has no name but it is a sub class of it's parent class and it
overrides the methods of the parent class. We can create only one object for this
anonymous class.

ii) Another anonymous class is a class that implements all the methods of an interface.


Q3) Purpose of nested classes in java

Ans) Grouping of related classes : A class that is not re-usable can be defined as an
inner class.
To create More encapsulation : If we create any private variables inside the inner class
they can be accessed only by the inner class itself.
Code readability. Rather than creating a separate class file which is not reusable anyway
it is better to define an inner class so that it is easier to read and maintain.


Q4) Restrictions for anonymous inner class ?
Ans) Anonymous inner classes can't have any constructor because they don't have any class
names. They can't have static members inside this anonymous inner class. They can be
instantiated only once.
