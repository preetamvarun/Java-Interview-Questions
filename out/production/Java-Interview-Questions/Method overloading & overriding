Q1) Explain the difference Method overloading and Method overriding

-> Method overloading can occur in the same class. Method overloading means the method
will have the same name but it can have different parameter list and different return type.
Method overloading occurs in the same class. Method overloading is determined at the
compile time.

-> Whereas, Method overriding occurs in the sub class where a method in the parent class
will have the same signature and same name as the method in the sub class.
-> The access control of overriding method should be same or more than the
overridden method. Method overriding is determined at the run time.

Q2) What is a class in java ?

-> A class is a user defined data type. It determines a blue print or template for object.
It defines the behaviour of the object by having methods and fields. Through class we can
achieve encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance & abstraction.

Q3) what is an object in java ?

-> An object is an instance of the class. A class is a blue-print for an object contains
methods and fields. when we instantiate a class JVM allocates memory in the heap. An object
can have different states and behaviours based on how it is instantiated.

Q4) why is java a platform independent language? what is a byte code in java. explain JIT compilation ?
-> when we first write a java program and executes it, The first step is it will be
compiled to byte code which consists of series of instructions that java program needs
to execute. This conversion is done by java compiler which is part of JDK. The byte code
class  extension will be .class. Then it has to executed. There
are several steps that will happen when the code is executed. This byte code can be executed
by any machine that has JVM which makes java a platform independent language.

Step - 1 : Firstly, the JVM loads the byte code into memory for execution.

Step - 2 : Then the the byte code is verified thoroughly so that is it follows all the
java rules and is safe to execute. This is a verification step and it is crucial

Step - 3 : This step is optional, the jvm may decide to interpret the byte code meaning
It goes line by line in the byte code and converts into machine code and will be executed
by the CPU of that particular machine.

Step - 4 : while the code is being converted into machine code and executed JVM uses
something known as Just In Time Compiler.

Step - 5 : Profilling the data is gonna happen in this stage. It means jvm identifies
if there are parts of code that are frequently executed. It basically sees for optimization
that can be done in that code [Based on that particular machines hardware architecture].
Then with the help of that profilled data jvm converts this
optimizable chunk of code into machine level code which can then be translated into
machine level code and later on can be executed. This sort of execution is going to be
much faster.

Step - 6 : Caching is gonna happen. The jvm may store the generated machine level code
in the cache so that it can be execution in any future runs without doing the entire operation
again.

Q5) what is the difference between c++ and java ?
ans) C++ and Java are both powerful programming languages, but they have several differences in terms of their design, usage, and features. Here's a comparison of C++ and Java:

     1. **Language Type:**
        - C++: C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming.
        - Java: Java is primarily an object-oriented programming language with some support for functional programming.

     2. **Memory Management:**
        - C++: In C++, you have explicit control over memory management, which means you are responsible for allocating and freeing memory (using `new` and `delete` operators).
        - Java: Java uses automatic memory management (garbage collection), which handles memory allocation and deallocation, making it less error-prone.

     3. **Platform Independence:**
        - C++: C++ code is compiled into machine-specific binary code, so it is less platform-independent. Code may need to be recompiled for different platforms.
        - Java: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it highly platform-independent.

     4. **Standard Library:**
        - C++: C++ has a powerful standard library (STL) that provides data structures (e.g., vectors, lists), algorithms, and various utilities.
        - Java: Java has a comprehensive standard library with extensive built-in classes for tasks like I/O, collections, networking, and more.

     5. **Pointers and References:**
        - C++: C++ allows the use of pointers and references, which offer fine-grained control over memory and object manipulation.
        - Java: Java does not have pointers or explicit references, which enhances safety but reduces low-level control.

     6. **Multiple Inheritance:**
        - C++: C++ supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to inherit from more than one class.
        - Java: Java does not support multiple inheritance via classes. It uses interfaces for achieving similar functionality.

     7. **Exceptions:**
        - C++: C++ uses exceptions for error handling but does not enforce their use.
        - Java: Java enforces the use of exceptions for error handling and has a strong exception-handling mechanism.

     8. **Threading:**
        - C++: C++ provides threading support through libraries like the C++ Standard Library or platform-specific libraries.
        - Java: Java has built-in support for multithreading, making it easier to develop concurrent applications.

     9. **Operator Overloading:**
        - C++: C++ allows operator overloading, which lets you define custom behaviors for operators like `+` or `-`.
        - Java: Java does not support operator overloading, which can help ensure code readability and consistency.

     10. **Low-Level System Programming:**
         - C++: C++ is commonly used for system-level programming and developing performance-critical applications.
         - Java: Java is not typically used for low-level system programming due to its platform-independent nature and managed memory.

     11. **Community and Ecosystem:**
         - C++: C++ has a well-established community and is commonly used in areas like game development, embedded systems, and system programming.
         - Java: Java has a vast ecosystem and is popular in web development, Android app development, and enterprise software.

     Both languages have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between C++ and Java depends on the specific requirements of your project and your programming preferences.


Q6) Explain about constructors in java

In Java, a constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects.
It is called when an object of a class is created, and its primary purpose is to set
up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its fields or properties.
Constructors have the following characteristics:

1. **Same Name as Class:** A constructor has the same name as the class it belongs to.
It does not have a return type, not even `void`.

2. **Initialization:** Constructors are responsible for initializing the object's state,
which includes setting initial values for its fields or properties.
This is typically done using parameters passed to the constructor.

3. **Default Constructor:** If a class does not explicitly define any constructors,
it is provided with a default constructor by the Java compiler.
The default constructor has no parameters and does very basic initialization.

4. **Overloading:** Like regular methods, constructors can be overloaded.
This means you can define multiple constructors with different parameter
lists to allow for different ways of initializing objects.

5. **Implicit and Explicit Invocation:** Constructors can be implicitly invoked
when an object is created using the `new` keyword.

Alternatively, you can explicitly call a constructor using the `this`
keyword or chaining it with another constructor in the same class using the
`super` keyword in the case of inheritance.


Q7) The `main()` method in Java is defined with specific modifiers (`public`, `static`,
and `void`) for several important reasons:

1. **public:** The `public` access modifier indicates that the `main()` method is
accessible from outside the class. This is required because it allows the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM) to locate and execute the `main()` method when you run a Java program.
Without `public`, the JVM wouldn't be able to access the `main()` method,
and the program would not execute.

2. **static:** The `static` modifier means that the `main()` method belongs to the class
rather than a specific instance of the class. Since the `main()` method serves as the
entry point for a Java program, it must be accessible without creating an
instance of the class. Making it `static` ensures that it can be called
directly on the class itself, like `ClassName.main(args)`,
without needing to create an object of the class.

3. **void:** The `void` return type indicates that the `main()`
method does not return any value when it completes its execution.
In the context of the `main()` method, it makes sense because
it's not expected to return any result.
Instead, its purpose is to start the execution of the program and
not return a value to the caller.

In summary, the combination of `public`, `static`, and `void` modifiers in the `main()`
method is necessary to make it accessible to the JVM as the entry point for a Java
application. The `public` modifier ensures it can be located from outside the class,
the `static` modifier allows it to be called without creating an instance, and the
`void` return type reflects that it doesn't return any value upon completion.
